  2. QA (qa branch)

  3. Stage (stage branch)
  ![image](images/stage.png)
  4. Prod (prod branch)
  ![image](images/prod.png)
  Create CI-CD pipeline for all env(same stages like previous assignment) which will use common jenkins shared library instead of pipeline script to build and deploy Spring3Hibernate app.

    configure the jenkins
    ![image](images/configure.png)
running project
